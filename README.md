# World_Weather_Analysis

## Challenge
### With the weather data already created, I needed to retrieve the weather data of 2000 random latitude and longitude points, sift out all the ones that is not close to a city, retrieve Lat and Lng, Max temp, % humidity, %cloudiness, windspeed and weather description from an API call, then add the weather data to a new DataFrame

### Next I needed to use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to show potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Once all data was formulated, use a marker layer map with pop-up markers to show the destinations.

### Last, using Google Directions API, I created a travel itinerary that shows the route between 4 cities chosen from the customers possible travel destination. I then created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each of the cities chosen.
